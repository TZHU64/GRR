# GRR Calculation

Python codes that calculate Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility GRR/GR&amp;R by ANOVA and R



Each folder in the directory represents an operator.

Inside each folder, there are Excel files that correspond to trials conducted by that operator.

Each cell in these Excel files represents a part of the trial conducted by the respective operator. 



To begin, Python must be installed on the system.

On the first run, run install.bat to install necessary libraries.

Execute run.bat to calculate Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility GRR/GR&amp;R by ANOVA and R.
